# Course projet web2 Mehdi Benallal

- Made this readme with : https://readme.so/


## Description

For web2 we had to create a full stack website with a working front and backend that are both linked to a database.

I decided to shift to a video game website instead of a movies since i have a bigger passion for video games.

I did a complete overhaul of my design, made it more compact and easier to code because sometimes simplicity is better.

This project includes a login system and bookmark system as seen in the lessons.
